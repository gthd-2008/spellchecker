## Building the Program

### **Linux**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root (the folder should be named `spellchecker`).
3. Run:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```
4. The compiled program will appear in `./bin/` as `main`.

## Running the Program

From the repository’s root directory, in the **Terminal** (Linux) or the **Developer Terminal** (windows Visual Studio), run:

* **Linux:**

  ```sh
  ./bin/main
  ```

* windows:

  ```bat
  .\bin\main.exe
  ```

The program accepts **one optional command-line argument**: a filepath to a custom dictionary.
If more than one argument is provided, the program behaves as if none were given.
If no argument is passed, it loads the default dictionary.
